What have you noticed that's wrong with the world? A severe lack of Shishir. ğŸ˜®

Shishchat solves this problem. You get a full fledged social media web application capable of chatting with users, making posts, and editing a profile, all in a shishir themed environment! ğŸ™Œ

Shishchat's frontend is made with React.js, the backend is made with Spring Boot and Java, and the database is made with Postgresql.
