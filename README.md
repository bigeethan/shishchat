What have you noticed that's wrong with the world? A severe lack of Shishir.

Shishchat solves this problem. You get a full fledged social media web application capable of chatting with users, making posts, and editing a profile, all in a shishir themed environment!

Shishchat's frontend is made with React.js, the backend is made with Spring Boot and Java, and the database is made with Postgresql.
