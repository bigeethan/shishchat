What have you noticed that's wrong with the world? A severe lack of Shishir. 😮

Shishchat solves this problem. You get a full fledged social media web application capable of chatting with users, making posts, and editing a profile, all in a shishir themed environment! 🙌

This is the frontend and it's made with React.js. The backend is in another repository.

(This project started off based on a joke with my friend, but it has turned into a serious project of mine)
