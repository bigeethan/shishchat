What have you noticed that's wrong with the world? A severe lack of Shishir. 😮

Shishchat solves this problem. You get a full fledged social media web application capable of chatting with users, making posts, and editing a profile, all in a shishir themed environment! 🙌

This is the frontend and it's made with React.js.
